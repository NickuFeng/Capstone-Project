## Project Goal

This project uses two deep learning algorithms, [Enformer](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/enformer) and [PredixCan](https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan#:~:text=PrediXcan%20is%20a%20gene%2Dbased,be%20causal%20for%20the%20phenotype.), to predict mRNA levels from DNA sequence data. These two models are very different from each other. Knowing that PredixCan loses some prediction accuracy when the input data is non-European ancestry, we are comparing two models' prediction to gain some insights about how to improve the model in future.
